6. **Summary:**
  Since last iteration, we have created a backend server to handle fetching of FCQ data and connected this to the HTTPRequestor class (and by extension, the LocalDataCache class). We also implemented a significant portion of the ChartDisplay class, adding a DataPoint class in the process, to provide the needed data to the `ChartDisplay.display()` function without hacky workarounds. 
7. **Breakdown of Work:**
  Connor: Implemented ChartDisplay component, configured data visualization libraries, helped revise the class diagram.
